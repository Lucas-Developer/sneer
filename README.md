Sneer - A Platform for Sovereign Computing Apps
-----------------------------------------------
Sneer is an open source platform for sharing media, data, applications or anything you want with anyone you care. There are no servers in the way, no eavesdropping middlemen, no companies to own your data, no strings attached. It's your stuff, your computer, your privacy, your friends... your decision. It's cool, easy and free.

I want to contribute!
---------------------
That's great!

First take a look at the wiki to set up your [development environment](https://github.com/sneerteam/sneer/wiki/Android-Development-Environment) then go to Sneer's [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/lEdEIxxA/sneer) and look for something you can do. There's lots of cards there so we recommend starting with the green labeled ones.

Let us know if you hit any roadblocks. Sneer is under heavy development and the way things are done often change.
