I want to contribute!
---------------------
That's great!

First take a look at our wiki to set up your [development environment](https://github.com/sneerteam/sneer/wiki/Android-Development-Environment) and then go to our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/lEdEIxxA/sneer) to look for something you can do. We recommend the green labeled cards to get you started.
