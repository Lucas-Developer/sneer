I want to contribute!
---------------------
That's great!

First take a look at the wiki to set up your [development environment](https://github.com/sneerteam/sneer/wiki/Android-Development-Environment) then go to Sneer's [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/lEdEIxxA/sneer) and look for something you can do. There's lots of cards there so we recommend starting with the green labeled ones.
